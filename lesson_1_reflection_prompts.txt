How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    It saved time to find bugs

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can switch to any version of file if required

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?
	Pros:
    Creating manual commit helps us to remember and has the flexability to choose the size of different versions of files we create.
    Cons:
    Creating manual commit can be dangerous if one has big size commit and that commit has a bug which need to reset the repository head to previous commit then his/her complete work could loose due to one bug.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Treating each file seperately gives more fleability to revret back to it's previous version since reverting commits won't affect others files that has been changed simultaneously.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    git log is used to see all the commits made to a repository where as git diff is used to find differences between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    Because a developer always knows that he/she can revert back to last commit he has made

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    version control
